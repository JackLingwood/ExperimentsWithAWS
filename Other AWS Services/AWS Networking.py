# An Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network
# that you define.

# Subnets
# Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
# Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
# Subnets allow you to organize resources based on security and operational needs.
# Subnets are used to organize your resources and can be made publicly or privately accessible. A private subnet is commonly used to contain
# resources like a database storing customer or transactional information. A public subnet is commonly used for resources like a customer-facing
# website.
# Subnets are used to organize resources, share resources publicly, or isolate resources to keep them private.

# AWS Cloud >> AWS Region >> AWS Availability Zone >> AWS VPC >> Subnet

# You can place EC2 instances in a subnet, and you can also place other resources like RDS databases or Lambda functions.
# Subnets can be public or private, depending on whether they have a route to the internet

# Subnets are chunks of ip address space that you can use to organize your resources.
# Subnets are used to organize resources, share resources publicly, or isolate resources to keep them private.


# An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
# It serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routbound traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances
# that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.

# A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the VPN connection between your VPC and your data center.
# It is the AWS side of a VPN connection. A virtual private gateway is a logical, fully redundant distributed edge routing function that sits at the edge of your VPC.
# It allows you to connect your VPC to your on-premises network using a VPN connection.

# A NAT gateway is a managed NAT service that provides outbound internet access to instances in a private subnet.
# It allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet.

# AWS Client VPN is a networking service you can use to connect your remote workers and on-premises networks to the cloud. It is a fully managed, elastic
# VPN service that automatically scales up or down based on user demand. Because it is a cloud VPN solution, you donâ€™t need to install and manage hardware
# or try to estimate how many remote users to support at one time.
# Benefits: AWS Client VPN provides advanced authentication, remote access. It is elastic and fully managed.
# Use case: It can be used to quickly scale remote-worker access.


# AWS Site to Site VPN
# AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed service that allows you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office to your Amazon VPC.`
# It establishes a secure and encrypted connection over the internet, enabling you to extend your data center or office network to the AWS cloud.
# AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a managed service that allows you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office to your Amazon VPC.
# Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your data center or branch offices and your AWS Cloud resources.

# AWS Direct Connect
# AWS Direct Connect is a private, dedicated AWS connection to your data center or office.

# Access control in a VPC is done using security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).
# Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
# Network ACLs provide an additional layer of security by allowing you to control traffic at the subnet level.
# Security groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow an incoming request, the response is automatically allowed.
# Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic.
# Security groups are used to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level, while network ACLs are used 
# to control traffic at the subnet level.


# All EC2 instances disallow all inbound traffic by default.
# You can allow inbound traffic by adding rules to the security group associated with the instance.
# Security groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow an incoming request, the response is automatically allowed.
# Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic.

# For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow.
# Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule makes sure that if a packet doesnâ€™t match any of the
# other rules on the list, the packet is denied.

# Security groups operate at instance level, while network ACLs operate at subnet level.
# Security groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow an incoming request, the response is automatically allowed.
# Network ACLs are stateless, meaning that you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic
# Security groups only allow type rules, while network ACLs allow both type and port rules.
# Type rules are used to allow or deny traffic based on the protocol and port number, while port rules are used to allow or deny traffic based on the port number only.
# With security groups return traffic is automatically allowed, while with network ACLs return traffic must be explicitly allowed.
# Security groups are useful for fine-grained control over instance-level traffic, while network ACLs are useful for broader control over subnet-level traffic.
